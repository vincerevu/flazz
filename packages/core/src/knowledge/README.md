# Knowledge Graph System

This directory contains the knowledge graph building system that processes emails and meeting transcripts to create an Obsidian-style knowledge base.

## Components

### `build_graph.ts`
Main orchestrator that:
- Processes source files (emails/transcripts) in batches
- Runs the `note_creation` agent to extract entities
- Only processes new or changed files (tracked via state)

### `graph_state.ts`
State management module that tracks which files have been processed:
- Uses hybrid mtime + hash approach for change detection
- Stores state in `~/Flazz/knowledge_graph_state.json`
- Provides modular functions for state operations

### `sync_gmail.ts` & `sync_fireflies.ts`
Sync scripts that:
- Pull data from Gmail and Fireflies
- Save as markdown files in their respective directories
- Trigger knowledge graph build after successful sync

## How It Works

### Change Detection Strategy

The system uses a **hybrid mtime + hash approach**:

1. **Quick check**: Compare file modification time (mtime)
   - If mtime unchanged → file definitely hasn't changed → skip

2. **Verification**: If mtime changed, compute content hash
   - If hash unchanged → false positive (mtime changed but content didn't) → skip
   - If hash changed → file actually changed → process

This is efficient (only hashes potentially changed files) and reliable (confirms actual content changes).

### State File Structure

`~/Flazz/knowledge_graph_state.json`:
```json
{
  "processedFiles": {
    "/path/to/file.md": {
      "mtime": "2026-01-07T10:30:00.000Z",
      "hash": "a3f5e9d2c8b1...",
      "lastProcessed": "2026-01-07T10:35:00.000Z"
    }
  },
  "lastBuildTime": "2026-01-07T10:35:00.000Z"
}
```

### Processing Flow

1. **Sync runs** (Gmail or Fireflies)
   - Fetches new/updated data
   - Saves as markdown files
   - Calls `buildGraph(SYNC_DIR)`

2. **buildGraph()**
   - Loads state
   - Scans source directory for files
   - Filters to only new/changed files
   - Processes in batches of 25
   - Updates state after each successful batch (saves progress incrementally)

3. **Agent processes batch**
   - Extracts entities (people, orgs, projects, topics)
   - Creates/updates notes in `~/Flazz/knowledge/`
   - Merges information for entities appearing in multiple files

## Replacing the Change Detection Logic

The state management is modular. To implement a different change detection strategy:

### Option 1: Modify `graph_state.ts`

Replace the functions while keeping the same interface:

```typescript
// Current: mtime + hash
export function hasFileChanged(filePath: string, state: GraphState): boolean {
    // Your custom logic here
}

export function markFileAsProcessed(filePath: string, state: GraphState): void {
    // Your custom tracking here
}
```

### Option 2: Create a new state module

Create `graph_state_v2.ts` with the same exported interface:

```typescript
export interface FileState { /* ... */ }
export interface GraphState { /* ... */ }
export function loadState(): GraphState { /* ... */ }
export function saveState(state: GraphState): void { /* ... */ }
export function getFilesToProcess(sourceDir: string, state: GraphState): string[] { /* ... */ }
export function markFileAsProcessed(filePath: string, state: GraphState): void { /* ... */ }
```

Then update the import in `build_graph.ts`:
```typescript
import { /* ... */ } from './graph_state_v2.js';
```

### Option 3: Pass a strategy object

Refactor to accept a change detection strategy:

```typescript
interface ChangeDetectionStrategy {
    hasFileChanged(filePath: string, state: GraphState): boolean;
    markFileAsProcessed(filePath: string, state: GraphState): void;
}

export async function buildGraph(sourceDir: string, strategy?: ChangeDetectionStrategy) {
    const detector = strategy || defaultStrategy;
    // Use detector.hasFileChanged(), etc.
}
```

## Resetting State

To force reprocessing of all files:

```typescript
import { resetGraphState } from './build_graph.js';

resetGraphState(); // Clears the state file
```

Or manually delete: `~/Flazz/knowledge_graph_state.json`

## Note Creation Strictness

The system supports three strictness levels that control how aggressively notes are created from emails. Meetings always create notes at all levels.

### Configuration

Strictness is configured in `~/Flazz/config/note_creation.json`:

```json
{
  "strictness": "medium",
  "configured": true
}
```

On first run, the system auto-analyzes your emails and recommends a setting based on volume and patterns.

### Strictness Levels

| Level | Philosophy |
|-------|------------|
| **High** | "Meetings create notes. Emails enrich them." |
| **Medium** | "Both create notes, but emails require personalized content." |
| **Low** | "Capture broadly. Never miss a potentially important contact." |

### What Each Level Filters

| Email Type | High | Medium | Low |
|------------|------|--------|-----|
| Mass newsletters | Skip | Skip | Skip |
| Automated/system emails | Skip | Skip | Skip |
| Consumer services (Amazon, Netflix, banks) | Skip | Skip | ✅ Create |
| Generic cold sales | Skip | Skip | ✅ Create |
| Recruiters | Skip | Skip | ✅ Create |
| Support reps | Skip | Skip | ✅ Create |
| Personalized business emails | Skip | ✅ Create | ✅ Create |
| Warm intros | ✅ Create | ✅ Create | ✅ Create |

### High Strictness

- Emails **never create** new notes (only meetings do)
- Emails can only **update existing** notes for people you've already met
- Exception: Warm intros from known contacts can create notes
- Best for: Users who get lots of emails and want minimal noise

### Medium Strictness

- Emails **can create** notes if personalized and business-relevant
- Filters out consumer services, mass mail, generic pitches
- Warm intros from anyone (not just existing contacts) create notes
- Best for: Balanced capture of relevant business contacts

### Low Strictness

- Creates notes for **any identifiable human sender**
- Only skips obvious automated emails and newsletters
- Philosophy: "Better to have a note you don't need than to miss someone important"
- Best for: Users with low email volume who want comprehensive capture

### Auto-Configuration

On first run, `strictness_analyzer.ts` analyzes your emails and recommends a level:

- **>100 human senders** → Recommends High (avoid overload)
- **50-100 senders** → Recommends Medium (balanced)
- **>50% consumer services** → Recommends Medium (filter noise)
- **<30 senders** → Recommends Low (comprehensive capture is manageable)

### Prompt Files

Each strictness level has its own agent prompt:
- `note_creation_high.md` - Original strict rules
- `note_creation_medium.md` - Relaxed for personalized emails
- `note_creation_low.md` - Minimal filtering

## Other Configuration

### Batch Size
Change `BATCH_SIZE` in `build_graph.ts` (currently 25 files per batch)

### State File Location
Change `STATE_FILE` in `graph_state.ts` (currently `~/Flazz/knowledge_graph_state.json`)

### Hash Algorithm
Change `crypto.createHash('sha256')` in `graph_state.ts` to use a different algorithm (md5, sha1, etc.)
