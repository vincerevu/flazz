This vault is your work memory.

Flazz extracts context from your emails and meetings and turns it into long-lived, editable Markdown notes. The goal is not to store everything, but to preserve the context that stays useful over time.

---

## How it works

**Entity-based notes**
Notes represent people, projects, organizations, or topics that matter to your work.

**Auto-updating context**
As new emails and meetings come in, Flazz adds decisions, commitments, and relevant context to the appropriate notes.

**Living notes**
These are not static summaries. Context accumulates over time, and notes evolve as your work evolves.

---

## Your AI coworker

Flazz uses this shared memory to help with everyday work, such as:

- Drafting emails
- Preparing for meetings
- Summarizing the current state of a project
- Taking local actions when appropriate

The AI works with deep context, but you stay in control. All notes are visible, editable, and yours.

---

## Design principles

**Reduce noise**
Flazz focuses on recurring contacts and active projects instead of trying to capture everything.

**Local and inspectable**
All data is stored locally as plain Markdown. You can read, edit, or delete any file at any time.

**Built to improve over time**
As you keep using Flazz, context accumulates across notes instead of being reconstructed from scratch.

If something feels confusing or limiting, we'd love to hear about it.
Flazz is still evolving, and your workflow matters.
